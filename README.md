About the Project
Hello! Welcome to our Chat-app, a dynamic platform where you can join rooms and broadcast messages. This project started as an exploration of how sockets work and how we can manage personal messages.

Current Features:
Join Rooms: Engage in different chat rooms to connect with various users.
Broadcast Messages: Send messages to everyone in a room simultaneously.
Next Steps:
Enhanced Chat Blocks: We're working on adding distinct sections for direct messages (DMs) and group chats, similar to WhatsApp.
Video Sockets and Streaming: Future updates will include video sockets and video streaming capabilities, enhancing our communication features.
Current Interface:
Here’s a snapshot of the current working interface. It might not be the prettiest, but it’s functional:

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to improve and expand the functionality of our chat app!
